## Slack Integration 

### Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this tutorial you need:

- A Slack workspace with administrative rights. [Learn how to create your Slack workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace).
- A [Watson Assistant Bee Travels Chatbot](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020#getting-started)

Now, I'll show you how to integrate your Slack workspace with your Bee Travels chatbot.

## Integrate Slack and your chatbot

### Step 1. 

Go to your Bee Travels Assistant and click **Add Integration**.

### Step 2.
In the Watson Assistant UI, scroll down to the section for "Third-party integration" and select **Slack**.

### Step 3.
First, you need to create a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps). Click on **Create New App**, name your application, and point to a Slack development workspace. Learn more about creating slack apps [here](https://api.slack.com/start).


### Step 4.
On the Slack app Settings page, go to the **Basic Information** tab and find the **App Credentials** section. Copy your verification token from that section.

Paste the verification token from step 4 and paste it into the appropriate area of Step 2 on Watson Assistant Slack integration page:

(Optional): Upload an App Icon and App Name in the Display information section of the **Basic Information** tab:

### Step 5.
Go to the **OAuth & Permissions tab**. In the **Bot Token Scopes** section, click **Add an Oauth Scope**, and then select the following scopes:`app_mentions:read` `chat:write` `im:history` `im:read` `im:write`.

### Step 6.
On the **OAuth & Permissions** tab, click **Install App to Workspace**, and then click **Allow**. You should be redirected back to the OAuth & Permissions page.

**Note** Make sure you copy your Bot User OAuth access token (`starts with xoxb`)  to both of the fields in **section 3** of Step 2 on Watson Assistant Slack integration page 
 
### Step 7.
On the Slack app settings page, go to the **Event Subscriptions** tab. Switch the **Enable Events** toggle to the On position. Go to Step 3 of the Watson Assistant Slack Integration page, click **Generate Requestt URL**. Paste the requested URL and verify its accuracy on the **Enable Events** page.

### Step 8.
On the Event Subscriptions tab, find the Subscribe to Bot Events section. Click **Add Bot User Event**, and then select the event types you want to subscribe to. You must select at least one of the following types: 

* `message.im`: Listens for message events that are posted in a direct message channel. 
* `app_mention`: Listens for only message events that mention your app or bot.

Make sure you save your changes.

### Step 9.
On the **App Home** tab. Click **Edit** and enter a display name and default username for your virtual assistant. Click **Save**. Enable the **Always Show My Bot as Online** toggle:

### Step 10.
On Watson Assistant Slack Integration page click **Save Changes**.

### Step 11.
Log into your Slack workspace and click on **Browse App**. Find the app you just created and add to your workspace:

### Step 12.
